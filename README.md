This is a page-mod made with the Addon SDK. It is designed to run on Native Fennec on
mobile: it will show the comics related to the news you're reading on penny-arcade.com,
just changing your device's orientation (from portrait to landscape).

Its purpose is merely to illustrate how to write add-ons for Native Fennec using
the Addon SDK.
